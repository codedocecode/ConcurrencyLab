# 🧪 ConcurrencyLab – Lab Rules

1. Do not trust comments. Trust observations.
2. Always predict the output before running.
3. Change one thing at a time.
4. If the result surprises you, stop and explain why.
5. Async does NOT imply parallelism.
6. Parallelism without understanding is a bug factory.
7. Tasks represent work; Threads execute work.
8. Use Task + async for I/O; Threads or Parallel for CPU-bound work.
